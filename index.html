                        <p>Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz whose research integrates phonological theory, 
                            phonetics, and computational modeling to explore how sounds and words are represented and learned. 
                            I focus especially on the languages of Pakistan, combining fieldwork, experimental methods, 
                            and formal modeling to investigate the structure and acquisition of sound systems.</p>

                        <p>As a linguist, I aim to answer foundational questions about the nature of linguistic representation: 
                            What forms do humans use to store sounds and words in memory? How do these representations interact? 
                            How detailed or abstract are they? What linguistic and cognitive factors shape them? How are they acquired over time?</p>

                        <p>I approach these questions through original fieldwork, computational and quantitative modeling, and traditional linguistic analysis.</p>

                        <p>An aspect of my career that is extremely important to me is the preservation and promotion of understudied languages in Pakistan. 
                            To this end, I often spend my summers in Pakistan hosting documentation workshops, conducting fieldwork, 
                            and working with communities to develop linguistic materials for use in language promotion and preservation.</p>
